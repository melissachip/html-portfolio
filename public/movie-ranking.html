<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Tangled</h3>
<p>
  Tangled is 100% a comfort movie. I literally rewatched it last night. It has a
  good message, characters, and is beautiful to watch. Also I'm almost at the
  point of fulling knowing the script. Disney please hire me!

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  Recently watched this movie because it's a very popular movie, call it
  bandwagon or whatever. Interstellar kept me thrilled and also made me realize
  how SHORT time is in space TT. Highly recommend.

<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>
  I recently watched this at the theater. It was a fun watch. I liked the
  satireness of the story. Let me give you one clue. PINK PINK PINK! Enough said
  :) It made me cry. Oh, one more clue: glitter!
